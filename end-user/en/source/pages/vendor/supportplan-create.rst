Creating a Support Plan
-----------------------

You must attach a support plan to all products added to the marketplace. You can create as many support plans as you wish. Note that when you attach a support plan to a product and then update the support plan, all products that use this support plan will be updated with the new support plan.

For example, if you have a support plan called “BusinessHr” which covers 9am to 5pm CET and you modify the description to say it covers 8 am to 6 pm CET all the products that have the support plan BusinessHr will be updated with the new description.

Support Plans are a separate entity (object). It includes:

	* a name (mandatory)
	* a description
	* a support email

You can also include links to external resources such as: documentation, phone number, a URL to an external forum, bugtracker.
