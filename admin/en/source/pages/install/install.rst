Installing the Marketplace
===========================

This section covers the steps required to correctly install and configure the UForge Marketplace on one node.  UForge Marketplace is delivered via multiple media types depending on the infrastructure where you will install the platform.  This includes:

   * ISO image
   * OpenStack QCOW2 Image
   * VMware OVA
   * Amazon AMI

Regardless of media type, the installation procedure is the same.  This chapter describes installing from a VM image on one node (note the installation can be done over several nodes for higher scalability and performance).

This tutorial assumes that you have already contacted UShareSoft and received the downloaded media type.
