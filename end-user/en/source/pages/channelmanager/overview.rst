Marketplace Channel Manager Actions
===================================

If you have a channel manager account for the Marketplace, you will be able to manage vendors and products on the Marketplace.  All products created must be approved before they are visible; this is the responsability of the Channel Manager.

The following sub-sections go into detail on the actions related to posting and selling products on the Marketplace. For information on creating products, refer to :ref:`overview-vendor`.
