2. If you have several vendors, click on the Vendor who will be the creator to the product item.
3. Click on the product for which you want to edit a product item. You will see a list of the currently available product items.
4. Click on the pencil icon on the right-hand of the product item you want to edit. You will see the same windows as per when you created a product item.
5. Modify the necessary elements and click on the next arrow.
