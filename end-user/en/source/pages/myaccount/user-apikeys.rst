Managing API Keys
-----------------

API Keys are used to communicate with UForge AppCenter more securely when using the platform APIs (rather than using basic authentication).

If you have the rights, you will be able to manage your API keys. See your UForge Administrator to be given these rights, if needed.

The number of API key pairs that a user can create is set by the administrator. If you have reached your quota of key pairs, contact your administrator.

To create a key pair: 

	1. Click on the ``My Account`` tab and go to ``API Keys``. 
	2. Click ``create``.
