Managing Reviews
----------------

As an administrator you can moderate reviews and notes posted on products. You can choose to either:

	* censor a comment, in which case on the Marketplace a note will indicate the name of the user but the review will not appear. A note will indicate that the review was moderated.
	* delete a comment. In this case the comment is completely deleted and no trace is left.
