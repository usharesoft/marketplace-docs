Assigning Product to a Channel Manager
--------------------------------------

Once a product is created on the Marketplace by a Vendor, it must be approved by a Channel Manager before it is visible to users of the Marketplace.

As Administrator you must assign new products to a Channel Manager for approval. To do so:

	1. Go to the Products page.
	2. Select the product from the product list. You can filter the products by clicking on Submitted on the right-hand side.
	3. Choose the assignee from the drop-down menu.

Once you have selected the Channel Manager (assignee), this person manages the approval process.
