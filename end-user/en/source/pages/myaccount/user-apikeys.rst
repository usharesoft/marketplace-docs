Managing API Keys
-----------------

API Keys are used to communicate with UForge Marketplace more securely when using the platform APIs (rather than using basic authentication).

If you have the rights, you will be able to manage your API keys. See your Marketplace Administrator to be given these rights, if needed.

The number of API key pairs that a user can create is set by the administrator. If you have reached your quota of key pairs, contact your administrator.

Adding an API Key Pair
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a key pair: 

	1. Click on the key icon on the left-hand side to go to the ``API Keys`` page.
	2. Click on the ``create+`` icon on the top right-hand side. A new key pair is created.
