Creating a Marketing Plan
-------------------------

The marketing plan is a library of elements that help promote the product. It includes a unique name, category, logo, tag line, and product overview (description) and product details. You can also add resources. Currently the resources are URLs but in the future UForge Marketplace will support images and videos.

You can create as many marketing plans as you wish. Note that when you attach a marketing plan to a product and then update it, all products that use this marketing plan will be updated with the new information. Having a library of Marketing plans is useful particularly then you have several products for different types, but the marketing information remains the same.

1. Go to the ``My Listings`` page.
2. Click on the Vendor (if you are part of more than one vendor group).
3. Go to the ``Marketing`` Plan page.
4. Click on the ``create +`` button in the right-hand side.
