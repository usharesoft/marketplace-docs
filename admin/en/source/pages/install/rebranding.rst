Rebranding UForge Marketplace
-----------------------------

The presentation layer is built using GWT (Google Web Toolkit) that produces HTML, Javascript and CSS.  A configuration file named config.xml is provided to facilitate basic customization of the user interface.  For more advanced rebranding, a custom CSS file is used to override the default stylesheets provided in UForge Marketplace.
The configuration file is located in::

	/var/opt/UShareSoft/customization/marketplace-client/config.xml

The custom css file to use for overriding default stylesheets is located in::

	/var/opt/UShareSoft/customization/marketplace-client/css/custo.css
