Purchasing a Product
--------------------

Purchasing a product from the Marketplace involves the following steps:

	1. Select your product item. This will send a request to a third party billing system.
	2. When the billing system validates the purchase, this creates a download ticket.
	3. You then receive a unique URL for download.
	4. You can use the URL to download the product item.
	5. Once the download is complete, the URL is no longer valid.

To purchase a product:

	1. Login to the Marketplace.
	2. Click to view the details of the product.
	3. Go to the ``Pricing`` page.
	4. If there are several versions and pricing options, select the one you want by clicking ``Sign Up``.
	5. Accept the terms and conditions and click ``buy``.

Viewing Products Purchased
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the purchase has been validated by the billing system, the product will appear under ``My Purchase``.

If you have not paid for a product (completed the payment on the billing page) the product will appear on the ``My Purchases`` page but will have an option to ``pay now``. If you want to use the product, you need to click on the icon and complete the payment

	* Validated: This means that you have successfully completed the payment and that the product is available.
