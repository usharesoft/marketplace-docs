Submitting a Product for Approval
---------------------------------

Once a product has been created, you must submit it for approval by a Channel Manager before it can be visible on the Marketplace.

You cannot submit a product for Approval until it has the necessary elements, including artifact, Marketing Plan, and Pricing Plan.

If a product is rejected, you can modify and resubmit the product for approval. Throughout the approval process, you and the Channel Manager can post notes on the product approval.

1. Go to the ``My Listings`` page.
2. Click on the Vendor (if you are part of more than one vendor group).
3. From the Product Listings, on the right of the Product you want to submit for approval you will see the status ``NEW``. Click on the submittal check-board icon.
4. You will see the status changed to ``SUBMITTED``.
